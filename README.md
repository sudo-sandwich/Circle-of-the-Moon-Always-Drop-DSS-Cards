# Circle-of-the-Moon-Always-Drop-DSS-Cards
A romhack for Castlevania: Circle of the Moon that forces enemies to always drop a DSS card if you are missing their DSS card.

Compile using [armips](https://github.com/Kingcom/armips). You will need a US copy of the game.

This romhack places its instructions at the address `0x087f0000`, which I chose randomly. You should be able to change the `UnusedAddress` label to a different (unused) address and the hack should still work.
